A simple view.

The foot of the castle has a remarkable design that has stood the test of time. Stones are layered throughout the exterior walls. They are oblong, triangular, short, large, cracked. Yet, they are still there. Records indicate many benefits but one in particular is how they allow for the passage of water; it rains frequently and in large proportions where Kochi is situated on Shikoku. If water is not allowed to pool, it is far less likely to cause erosion or deterioration. 

Elements of construction like that are why the beautiful view from the top still exists.

While the image in view has changed over time, the castle remains.
