Off-season slumber.

This old-fashioned train, a _stove train_, is operated by Tsugaru Railways in Aomori Prefecture only during the cold, snowy winter. What makes it a stove train? Inside this train is a coal-fired stove used to grill foods like dried squid and cuttlefish. Sadly or perhaps fortunately, this is only for the cold of winter!

On this particular mid-autumn day, the train sat quietly at Goshogawara Station waiting for its hibernation to be over.
