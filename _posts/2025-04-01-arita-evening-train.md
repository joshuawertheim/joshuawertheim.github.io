Mundane and routine to some, exciting to many. 

Arita is a town of porcelain. Its primary export is ceramic, in various shapes, styles, and sizes, for all manners of occasion. 

Wander the streets of the town and you will find brilliant and exquisite pottery. There are art pieces. There are very standard meal plates. Water cups. Sake cups.

Unfortunately, the town is in desperate need of visitors and shoppers. The main street of Arita Sera can stand like it is part of a movie set for a ghost town. The shops, quite empty, have passionate staff who love to show patrons around their beautiful products. 

In some ways the town is as beautiful as a train rolling over a track in the last rays of sunset: quietly existing, with some travelers passing through... yet, lying in the beautiful countryside.
