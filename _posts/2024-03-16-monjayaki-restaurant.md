Wednesday night.

Everyone knows about Shibuya, Shinjuku, Shinbashi.

Golden Gai. Omeyoko. Omoide Yokocho.

These are all places that are busy with the after-work rush of salarypeople. Tourists who visit Japan see these as the popular places because they are always so busy.

Yet, by spending time exploring lesser-known (by foreigners) neighborhoods, such as Tsukishima, you can find these warm and breezy neighborhoods filled to the brim with conversation and metal clangs from spatulas hitting the teppanyaki to cook up Monjayaki!
