My name is Joshua Wertheim.

I have naturally become interested in many hobbies over the years.

Baseball, cars, photography.

Perhaps conveniently, these all are a tremendous part about what makes Japan great.

I have visited several times now and have grown a collection of awesome memories and stories that I would love to share. These will become _the series_. 

Actually, intrepid readers may point out that Japan's final NPB postseason series ([Nippon Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Series)) is typically also called the "Japan Series".
