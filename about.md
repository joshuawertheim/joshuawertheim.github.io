Joshua Wertheim is a Software Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. 

He has naturally become interested in a handful hobbies over the years.

Baseball, cars, photography -- these are just a few!

Perhaps conveniently, they all have tremendous meaning about what makes Japan great.

Joshua has visited Japan several times and has grown a collection of awesome memories and stories that he loves to share. These are and will become _the Japan Series_[^1]. 

[^1]: Actually, intrepid readers may point out that Japan's final NPB postseason series ([Nippon Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Series)) is typically also called the "Japan Series".
