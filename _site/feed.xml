<p>Off-season slumber.</p>

<p>This old-fashioned train, a <em>stove train</em>, is operated by Tsugaru Railways in Aomori Prefecture only during the cold, snowy winter. What makes it a stove train? Inside this train is a coal-fired stove used to grill foods like dried squid and cuttlefish. Sadly or perhaps fortunately, this is only for the cold of winter!</p>

<p>On this particular mid-autumn day, the train sat quietly at Goshogawara Station waiting for its hibernation to be over.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="restaurant" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An old-fashioned stove train in Goshogawara, Aomori]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Monjayaki Shop</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/restaurant/2024/03/16/monjayaki-restaurant.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Monjayaki Shop" /><published>2024-03-16T19:40:18-07:00</published><updated>2024-03-16T19:40:18-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/restaurant/2024/03/16/monjayaki-restaurant</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/restaurant/2024/03/16/monjayaki-restaurant.html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/53s8qxofe8xxwkgom9w3v/manjuyaki_storefront.jpg?rlkey=ey1gixjry4qr0oz3az82shgh9&amp;raw=1" alt="alt text" title="Storefront for a Monjayaki restaurant in Tsukishima" /></p>

<p>Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Everyone knows about Shibuya, Shinjuku, Shinbashi.</p>

<p>Golden Gai. Omeyoko. Omoide Yokocho.</p>

<p>These are all places that are busy with the after-work rush of salarypeople. Tourists who visit Japan see these as the popular places because they are always so busy.</p>

<p>Yet, by spending time exploring lesser-known (by foreigners) neighborhoods, such as Tsukishima, you can find these warm and breezy neighborhoods filled to the brim with conversation and metal clangs from spatulas hitting the teppanyaki to cook up Monjayaki!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="restaurant" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A small Monjayaki shop located on Tsukishima in Tokyo]]></summary></entry></feed>
